3 Things I learned: 

1. Learnt how to better use the terminal on windows.

2. Got a better understanding of Boolean, since it is a type of data that can only be true or false.

3. Learned that Javascript can now be used for non-wep apps.



Two things I found confusing:

1. Out putting a message to the console.

2. Had a rough time getting an understanding of when to use the quotation marks in the terminal.




One word for how I'm feeling:

Sleepy.
